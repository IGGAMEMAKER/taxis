    DESCRIPTION                                           
    for urls with authentication, you need to send authKey and phone variables too               
    for example (url POST /orders) :                                      
    {                             
      phone:'89888888888',                        
      authKey:'ad03dj0as9dja',                                  
      orders: [order1, order2]                              
    }
